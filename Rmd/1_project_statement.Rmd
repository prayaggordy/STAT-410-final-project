## Project statement

Infant mortality is a widespread issue worldwide. Countless sums of money are poured annually into research and programs to prevent the death of children younger than one year. High rates of infant mortality, which the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines as the number of infant deaths per $`r scales::comma(config$rate)`$ live births, are common in South Asia and Africa.

Targeted interventions and general improvements in access to and quality of healthcare has decreased the infant mortality rate in the United States, but disparities persist. People of color and of lower income are at higher risk of losing a child before their first birthday. In this project, I will examine infant mortality in `r outcome %>% dplyr::pull(fips) %>% unique() %>% length()` counties in the United States. I will consider demographic information as predictors of county-level infant mortality rates in an attempt to find significant associations.
