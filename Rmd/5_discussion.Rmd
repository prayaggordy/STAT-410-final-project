## Summary and discussion

### Limitations
The suppression of data from counties with low infant mortality almost certainly impacted the results. Figure \@ref(fig:map) shows the included counties, which surround cities and have high populations. Much of the Midwest is not included in the sample. A future study could use data from a multi-year period, over which time many more counties would experience enough infant deaths to bypass the suppression threshold.
