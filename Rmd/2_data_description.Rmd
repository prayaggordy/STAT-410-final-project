## Data description

```{r data-collection}
lapply(config$sources,
			 function(source) {
			 	c("Data" = source$description, 
			 		"Source" = source$name, 
			 		"Link" = source$url, 
			 		"Collection" = source$collected)
			 }) %>% 
	dplyr::bind_rows() %>% 
	knitr::kable(caption = "Collection methods for data",
							 escape = TRUE) %>% 
	kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The data were collected as described in Table \@ref(tab:data-collection). Our outcome data will serve as our $y$ variables in regression, while our demographic data will serve as predictors. These demographic data will help show significant associations between indicators such as race and healthcare coverage with infant mortality.
